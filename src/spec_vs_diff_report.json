  "summary": "The diff clearly updates global CSS design tokens to a new pastel OKLCH palette (light + dark) and duplicates the same token set in both `frontend/src/index.css` and `frontend/index.css`, addressing the theme-token inconsistency. It also begins tuning marketing utility classes (e.g., `.marketing-card` hover/border). However, the diff also modifies meta/documentation-like files describing extensive page redesigns and new behaviors that are out of scope for a theme-only refresh.",

      "description": "Large-scale marketing page redesigns and new/updated assets/components described (e.g., Collabstr-inspired structure, new collage/illustrations/avatars, new SocialProofStrip/HowItWorks components).",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest explicitly limits scope to a visual theme refresh (no new pages/flows/features). The diff includes a modified summary file asserting substantial UI/page rework beyond global theming; these changes are not requested and are not evidenced as actual code diffs (only as descriptions).",
